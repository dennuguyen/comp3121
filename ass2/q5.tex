\subject{Question 5 by Dan Nguyen (z5206032)}

    There is a given array, $A$, of size $n$, which stores the number of weeks, $A[i] = t_{i}$ required to complete course $i$.

    There is another given array, $B$, of size $m$, where stores a pair of {\it unordered} pairs of {\it distinct} courses, $p$, and number of weeks, $t_{p}$, required to complete either course if one has been completed i.e. for some $b$ in $B$:
    \startformula b = \{p, t_{p} \} \stopformula
    \startformula p = \{i, j\}, t_{p} \leq \text{min}(t_{i}, t_{j}) \stopformula

    Construct a weighted undirected graph, $G$, represented as an adjacency list with $|E|$ edges and $|N|$ nodes. Nodes are each course in $A$ and edges are $p$ for each $b$ in $B$ with the weighting of $t_{p}$, therefore $|E| = m$ and $|N| = n$. Graph construction has an expected time complexity of $O(|N| + |E|) = O(n + m)$.

    To complete all $n$ courses with the minimal number of weeks, use Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning forest (MSF) of $G$ which returns a list of edges, $E_{i}$, for each minimum spanning tree (MST), $i$, within the MSF. This has an expected time complexity of $O(|E|log|V|) = O(mlog(n))$.

    For each $i$, find the node with the minimum number of weeks required to complete any course i.e. $M_{i}$, and sum $E_{i}$ for $S_{i}$. The minimum number of weeks required to complete all $n$ courses is thus the sum of all $M_{i}$ and $S_{i}$ in the MSF. Across all MSTs, this has an expected time complexity of $O(n)$.

    The final expected time complexity is therefore:
    \startformula O(n + m) + O(mlog(n)) + O(n) \in O((n + m)log(n + m)) \stopformula
    as required.
