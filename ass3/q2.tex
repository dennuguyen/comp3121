\subject{Question 2 by Dan Nguyen (z5206032)}

    Given an array, $A$, where $A[i] > 0$ $\forall$ $i \in [1, n]$.

    Let there be a subset, $S$, of $A$ whose sum is $0 \leq s \leq m$.

    Define $Q(s, i)$ as the problem of finding the largest $s$, of $S$ of $A[1..i]$ ending with $A[i]$.

    Define $\text{opt}(s, i)$ as the solution to $Q(s, i)$.

    For each $1 \leq i \leq n$ and initially $s = 0$, solve for $Q(s, i)$ using dynamic programming where the recurrence is:
    \startformula \text{opt}(s, i) = \text{max}\{ \text{opt}(s, i - 1) ,\; \text{opt}(s - A[i], i - 1) +  s \}\stopformula

    The base case is $\text{opt}(s, 1) = A[1]$ and $\text{opt}(0, i) = 0$. The order of solving $Q$ is important i.e. subproblems with lesser $s$ then lesser $i$ are solved first.

    The final answer is:
    \startformula \text{opt}(m, n) = \text{max}\{ \text{opt}(m, n - 1) ,\; \text{opt}(m - A[n], n - 1) +  m \} \stopformula

    The overall solution is $\text{opt}(m, n)$. There are $nm$ many subproblems which are solved in $O(nm)$. The time complexity of solving each subproblem is constant. Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O(nm)$ as required.
