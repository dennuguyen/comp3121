\subject{Question 3 by Dan Nguyen (z5206032)}

    Let there be a flow network represented as a directed graph with the following properties:
    \startitemize[nowhite, after]
        \item the flow is the number of spies moving to a stronghold;
        \item nodes are either a spy or stronghold coordinate i.e. $\{(x_{i}, y_{j}) \; | \; 1 \leq x, y \leq n\}$ and $\{(a_{i}, b_{j}) \; | \; 1 \leq i, j \leq m\}$ respectively;
        \item edges connect spies to strongholds i.e. an edge $\exists$ if $\sqrt{(x_{i} - a_{j})^{2} + (y_{i} - b_{j})^{2}} \leq v_{i} \cdot T$; and
        \item strongholds have a capacity of $1$.
    \stopitemize

    At this point of construction, it is recognised that the flow network is a {\it max bipartite matching} problem since spies and strongholds can be divided into two disjoint sets. Therefore, to convert the problem into a {\it max flow} problem, consider the additional properties for the flow network:
    \startitemize[nowhite, after]
        \item the super-source is an arbitrary coordinate with an edge to all spies;
        \item the super-sink is an arbitrary coordinate with an edge to all strongholds; and
        \item assign all edges in the flow network, a capacity of $1$.
    \stopitemize

    Let the max flow, $f$, be the max number of spies that can move from their original coordinate to a stronghold i.e. $f$ is at most $n$.

    To find $f$, apply the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to the flow network which will have a time complexity (for a {\it max bipartite matching} problem) of $O(|E||V|) = O(mn^{2})$.
